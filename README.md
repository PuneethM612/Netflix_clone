# Netflix Clone

A visually stunning and functional Netflix Clone built using modern web development technologies. This project replicates the user interface of Netflix and includes basic functionality for browsing and selecting content.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Dynamic Content**: Showcases movie and TV show titles fetched dynamically.
- **Sleek User Interface**: Replicates the original Netflix design with smooth transitions and animations.
- **Categorized Content**: Movies and shows displayed in genres for better navigation.
- **Trailer Previews**: Supports previewing trailers (if implemented with a third-party API).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Ensures a visually appealing and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactivity and dynamic content loading.
- **API Integration**: (Optional) Fetches data from a movie database API like [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
